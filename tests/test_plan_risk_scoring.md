# Risk Scoring System - Comprehensive Test Plan

## Executive Summary

This test plan ensures the risk scoring system provides consistent, accurate, and performant risk assessments (0-100 scale) across multiple asset classes for live trading environments. The system must maintain sub-100ms calculation times while providing reliable risk scores that align with actual market behavior.

## Testing Objectives

1. **Consistency**: Identical inputs produce identical risk scores across time
2. **Accuracy**: Risk scores correlate with actual market volatility and drawdowns
3. **Performance**: Sub-100ms calculation time per risk assessment
4. **Reliability**: System handles extreme market conditions without failure
5. **Calibration**: Risk scores properly distributed across 0-100 range for each asset class

## Asset Class Risk Score Expectations

- **Options (SPY/QQQ)**: 70-95 (high volatility, time decay)
- **Stocks (S&P 500)**: 30-80 (moderate volatility)
- **Bonds (Treasury/Corporate)**: 5-40 (lower volatility)
- **T-bills/CDs**: 0-20 (minimal risk)
