## 📊 **Recommendation Engine Flow**

### **1. Signal Generation**
```python
# Generate signals across all risk levels
signals = []
for ticker in top_tickers:
    for algorithm in [LSTM, ARIMA, Event_Driven]:
        for risk_level in [Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive, YOLO]:
            signal = create_transparent_signal(ticker, algorithm, risk_level)
            signals.append(signal)
```

### **2. User Profiling**
```python
# Calculate user's risk profile from interactions
user_profile = analyze_swipe_history(user_interactions)
risk_preference = calculate_risk_tolerance(user_profile)
confidence = assess_profile_stability(user_profile)
```

### **3. Personalized Ranking**
```python
# Rank signals by user relevance
for signal in signals:
    relevance_score = calculate_relevance(signal, user_profile)
    # Factors: risk match, win rate preference, complexity tolerance
    
personalized_signals = sort_by_relevance(signals)[:10]
```

### **4. Continuous Learning**
```python
# Learn from every interaction
def process_swipe(user_id, signal, action):
    if action == 'swipe_up':
        increase_preference(signal.type, signal.risk_level)
    elif action == 'swipe_down':
        decrease_preference(signal.type, signal.risk_level)
    
    update_user_profile(user_id)
    recalculate_recommendations(user_id)
```
